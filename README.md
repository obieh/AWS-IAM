# AWS-IAM
### This project will demonstrate how to create IAM in AWS.

### AWS IAM (Identity and Access Management) is a web service that allows you to manage access to AWS resources securely. It enables you to control who can access which AWS services and resources, and under what conditions. Essentially, IAM helps you manage users, security credentials (like access keys), and permissions to control access to your AWS environment.

## Benefits of IAM

### Centralized Management:
IAM allows you to centrally manage users, groups, roles, and permissions within your AWS account. 
### Authentication and Authorization:
It handles authentication (verifying who you are) and authorization (determining what you're allowed to do). 
### Fine-grained Access Control:
IAM enables you to grant very specific permissions, allowing users to access only the resources they need and nothing more. 
### No Additional Charge:
IAM is a core AWS service and is offered at no additional cost. 
### Key Concepts in IAM:
* Users: Individual accounts with permissions to access AWS resources. 
* Groups: Collections of users that share the same permissions. 
* Roles: Entities that can be assumed by trusted identities (users or applications) to grant them temporary permissions. 
* Policies: Documents that define permissions. They specify what actions a user, group, or role is allowed to perform on which AWS resources.
